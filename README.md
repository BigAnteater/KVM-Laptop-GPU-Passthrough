# KVM-Laptop-GPU-Passthrough
This is a simple and easy guide to setting up an Nvidia optimus laptop for GPU passthrough.
This guide is meant for advanced arch users who know about virtualization and troubleshooting.

# Setup

To set up your laptop for this guide, follow these steps:

Enable VT-d and VT-x/Intel Virtualization Technology in your laptops UEFI/BIOS.

Then install optimus manager. This can be installed using [yay](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yay).
```
yay -S optimus-manager optimus-manager-qt
```
Once installed, enable the optimus manager service so that it launches every time on startup.
```
sudo systemctl enable optimus-manager
```
Then finally, reboot your computer. [This guide](https://youtu.be/RZdWVntmvI8) is a very in depth guide about optimus manager, but I won't go too into detail. All that I stress you to do is not enable PCI-Remove or PCI-Reset. Once you are happy with your optimus manager config, we can continue.

Finally, clone the git repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/BigAnteater/KVM-Laptop-GPU-Passthrough && cd KVM-Laptop-GPU-Passthrough
```

# GRUB Configuration

I have made a script to configure the GRUB bootloader for IOMMU. I expect you to be using GRUB because systemd-boot sucks :trollface:

1) Mark the script as executable
```
chmod +x grub_config.sh
```
2) Run the script as a superuser
```
sudo ./grub_config.sh
```
3) Reboot your computer

# Libvirt Configuration

Once you have GRUB configured, you are going to want to set up libvirt. Once again I have set up a script for this because I want you guys to just sit around on your lazy bum.

Setting this up is pretty simple:

1) Mark the script as executable
```
chmod +x libvirt_config.sh
```
2) Run the script as a superuser
```
sudo ./libirt_config.sh
```
Now your Libvirt is good to go!

# Creating the virtual machine

Creating the virtual machine can be done in multiple different ways. I am doing the simple way for the sake of this guide but if you don't happen to have an external monitor + external kb/mouse scroll down to the alternative step.

To create the virtual machine, we will have to follow some pretty easy steps.

1) Open up the fancy new application installed on your computer named virt-manager

2) Create a new virtual machine under local install media

3) Download the windows 10/11 ISO from EvilCorp- sorry I meant Microsoft ðŸ¤®
4) Give the VM the ISO that you just downloaded

5) You can allocate ram & stuff but I would do that some time later.
6) Create a disk for your vm. I reccomend at least 60 gigabytes but allocate more if you want to get some stuff done.
7) Name the VM win10 and make sure to customize configuration before install.

8) Then make sure you are going to want to make sure your firmware is set to OVMF_Code.FD

7) Finally, remove the tablet, sound ich9, console 1, and both usb directors.
8) Then press begin installation and go through a normal windows installation.

# QEMU Hooks

To allow the virtual machine to detach your GPU from your laptop and attach the GPU to the VM, you will have to make a hooks script. To keep things simple, I have already made a hooks script for you. The hooks script is based off of [The Passthrough Post's](https://passthroughpo.st/simple-per-vm-libvirt-hooks-with-the-vfio-tools-hook-helper/) hooks script.

To install this script, just follow these steps:

1) Mark the hooks setup script as executable
```
chmod +x hooks_config.sh
```
2) Run the hooks setup script
```
sudo ./hooks_config.sh
```
If you get an error saying something along the lines of: "could not remove /etc/libvirt/hooks no such file or directory", it's not an error it is intended.
